# Mobile Checkout Android App
2nd semester project at AAU-CPH. Self-service mobile application used to scan barcodes of items, designed to replace self-service machines. App was synchronised with Firebase database supplying product data, and utilising Google Vision API for barcode discovery. During this project, I was mostly concerned with creating Software Requirements Specification document, along with programming in Android and taiga.io project management.
